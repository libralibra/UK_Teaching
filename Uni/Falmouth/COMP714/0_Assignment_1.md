## Introduction
[Top](#top)

This assignment entails a research project to showcase your comprehension of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. It provides an opportunity to experiment with ML frameworks explored during lectures and workshops. The objective is to create a small-scale machine-learning solution applicable to a specific task, such as controlling a game agent, content generation, analysing game-related datasets for prediction, or other suitable pursuits.

The project aims to address two fundamental ML questions for game-related AI:

- Can ML effectively accomplish a game-related task?
- How do varying parameters impact ML algorithm performance?

The assignment comprises the following sections:

### Problem Definition and Data Preparation
[Top](#top)

Commence your project by selecting a suitable problem and sourcing data for algorithmic work. This could involve a simple 2D game, an existing game framework, a dataset from the ML literature, or unconventional applications of well-known datasets like `mnist`. The choice must demonstrate originality or a new perspective. Familiarity with Python or `ML.Net` is recommended, with tools such as `PyGame`, `Turtle` for Python, and `MonoGame` for C# development.

Utilise learned techniques from `COMP712 - Classical Artificial Intelligence` for symbolic AI to generate training data. Design an easily adaptable AI for data output, essential for online learning.

### Feature Selection
[Top](#top)

Many datasets or games offer varied fields for ML algorithm training, necessitating adjustments or the creation of new features for optimal performance. Iterating on feature selection is integral to the ML process. Explore different features for AI input, selecting and modifying them based on feedback and experimentation stages.

> NOTE:
> Maintain records of attempted strategies and outcomes for the second assignment.

### Fundamental Machine Learning Experiments
[Top](#top)

Experiment with your chosen approach's parameters to assess algorithmic performance. Given the limited timeline (6 weeks), swift iterations and start of evaluation by week 3 are crucial. Avoid last-minute attempts at AI training, as it won’t yield results.

## Assignment Format
[Top](#top)

The assignment includes these parts:

### Project Outline
[Top](#top)

This single **formative** assessment involves presenting your research plan during the week 2 workshop. Briefly outline your chosen application as a testbed, targeted AI for ML, and an overview of data and ML processing.

### Monitoring Your Progress
[Top](#top)

A series of continuous **formative** assessments during weekly workshop sessions allow discussions on research progress, providing informal feedback.

### Submit a Demonstration Video
[Top](#top)

This **summative** submission involves preparing a 2-5 minute video demonstrating your ML application. Submit the video link via [Microsoft Streams](https://www.microsoft365.com/launch/stream) alongside your project repository link. Advanced editing is unnecessary; a raw screen capture is sufficient.

Formal feedback will be provided within 3 weeks.

### Attend the Viva
[Top](#top)

Participate in the scheduled viva session to discuss your work, constituting a **summative** submission. Informal feedback will be given during the viva.

## Additional Guidance
[Top](#top)

This research project requires careful planning and management. Approach it as an experiment, meticulously documenting each step and iteration in the ML process. Planning and time management are critical; commence work early and maintain a consistent pace, avoiding last-minute rushes.

Developing AI using symbolic and non-symbolic approaches demands significant effort and cannot be crammed before deadlines. There's a crucial phase of testing involved. Initiate work early, sustaining steady progress throughout the assignment.


## FAQ

## Introduction
[Top](#top)

This assignment is a companion to the ‘Application of Machine Learning’ in COMP714 and aims to document and reflect upon your experiences, challenges, and decision-making while exploring Machine Learning within AI topics. It's essential to distinguish this development journal from a personal blog; its assessment aligns with the provided marking rubric evaluating the following aspects:

### Problems: Description & Scope
[Top](#top)

Fundamentally, a development journal revolves around problem-solving. Describe the nature of the problem and why it poses an issue. Utilizing the 5Ws&H framework can help deconstruct problems. Understanding the problem's scope is crucial in gauging the effort required for resolution.

### Solutions: Synthesis & Quality
[Top](#top)

The solution section should narrate how the problem was resolved or addressed. In research, problems often demand multiple attempts before finding a robust solution. Documenting these attempts is vital, including failures or partially successful solutions, as they often lead to the desired solutions.

Reflect on the quality of the solutions developed; is it a temporary fix or does it conclude an investigative path?

### Writing and Diagramming
[Top](#top)

Effective communication in your writing is crucial. Aim for clarity and a professional tone rather than colloquial language, considering this is a development journal, not a blog.

Diagramming refers to non-textual presentations such as UML or visual models. Ensure clarity and proper referencing of diagrams, charts, or tables in relation to the text.

### Further Enquiries
[Top](#top)

‘Further enquiries’ encompass follow-up actions stemming from investigations into a problem/solution. Sometimes, these may lead to unrelated research paths, which should be noted for potential future exploration. Such enquiries might even redirect activities towards more advantageous approaches. Record these insights.

### Solution Reflections
[Top](#top)

Reflecting on problem-solving activities is personally beneficial. Evaluate the problem, its solution, and your approach. Are there alternative steps for future use? Did the final solution meet the desired outcomes?

## Assignment Format
[Top](#top)

This development journal complements your research and development activities, documenting your research process alongside development artifacts. The assignment consists of the following sections:

### Part A: The Research Plan
[Top](#top)

Present an outline research plan. This is a single **formative** submission. Deliver a brief presentation outlining your research plan during the week 4 workshop. Include details on the selected game for testing, the targeted AI aspects for Machine Learning, and an overview of the data and ML processing intended.

Use the journal to record the game selection process and initial thoughts on the ML process and experiments.

Informal feedback will be provided during the session.

### Part B: Record Your Progress
[Top](#top)

Regularly update your research progress. This is a single **formative** assessment conducted weekly during workshop sessions, allowing discussions with peers and lecturers regarding research progress.

Use the journal to document self-directed research activities, aiding memory and capturing valuable feedback during sessions.

Informal feedback will be provided during the session.

### Part C: Peer Review
[Top](#top)

Attend the peer review, a single **formative** submission after the reading week. Submit your journal link before the peer review session. Engage in reviewing colleagues' work, offering suitable support and suggestions.

Informal feedback will be provided during the session, and formal peer review feedback will be given afterward.

### Part D: Submission
[Top](#top)

Complete the journal on the [Falmouth journal system](http://journal.falmouth.ac.uk). This is a single **summative** submission. Add your development journal link to the learning space. Your submission will be assessed against the provided rubric.

If unfamiliar with the system, refer to the user guide and possibly the [short course](https://etsupport.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/4000163098-journal-short-course-for-students).

Formal feedback will be provided within 3 weeks.

## Additional Guidance
[Top](#top)

This assignment complements the COMP714 'Applications of Machine Learning Techniques' and serves as a repository documenting experimental outcomes during the development of data-driven approaches for AI. Delaying journal writing until the assignment's end diminishes its value and potential mark.

Avoid trivial, brief entries common in social media blogs when writing academic journals. Instead, use the journal as a repository for encountered problems, considered solutions, and experimental outcomes. Refer to the rubric for clear guidelines.

Reflect on previous experiences with reflective practice to create frameworks for evaluating experimental activities and gained insights.

Utilize the journal to capture dialogues between yourself, tutors, and peers during tutorial sessions.

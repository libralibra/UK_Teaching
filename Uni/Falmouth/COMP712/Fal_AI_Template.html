                                <li>Actually, artificial intelligence is not a new concept at all. If we look back to the human history, we can surprisingly find out that there were so many AI-related records in the past. For example, a life-sized automaton was described in an acient Chinese history book - it was dated to 1,000BC which was 3,000 years ago! According to the notes, the human-like robot could move its arms and legs automatically.</li>
                                <li>In 400BC, the famours Greek philosopher Plato descriped a mechnical pigeon that was created by one of his friends. It was said to be able to fly on its own.</li>
                                <li>Other early attempts include the Leonardo's Knight in 15th centruty and later Japanese robot in 1930s.</li>

                                <li>In 1952, Arthur Samuel created a programme that could learn to play checkers game indepndently. That's the first time ever that a computer programme really learnt to do something by its own.</li>
                                <li>In 1956, the Dartmouth workshop organised by Johan Macarthy and other scientists coined the term Artificial Intelligence. That was the first time AI was considered to be an independent area of computer science.</li>

                                <li>OK, the turing test is very simple. A computer and a person seat behind a wall. All we need to do during the test is to answer the question if A and B are human beings or machine purely based on their responses to written questions. Apparently, you cannot see them, or wave your hands to or even try to talk to the person - all these sorts of communications are forbidden and you have to rely on written text! A and B may switch seats randomly whenever they want.</li>
                                <li>If the person C cannot tell which one is machine and which one is human, we then consider that the machine passes the Turing Test. In other words, it has the equivalent level of intelligence as a human being!</li>

                                <li>These key requirements include: automatic computer - well, easy to understand as we are talking about intelligence, so the machine needs to compute without being told explicitly. Language understanding - fair enough as we need to interact with machines so they need to understand some kinds of agreed languages with certain rules. Use of neuron nets - biologists learnt from human brains far early than we thought. The basic perceptron model has been proposed at that time. And the computer scientists in Dartmouth workshop realised the importance of neuron nets already. We have to admit their insights on this area. Nowadays, various deep neural networks show their potential in so many ways. Computational efficiency is very important. In theory, a monkey can produce the full set of Shakespeare's manuscripts by typing randomly on the keyboard - it just takes times to get it in the correct order! But for most of our problems, we need the results in a certain period of time</li>

**Task 2: Guess My Number Game**
   - Write a script to implement the  [`Guess My Number`](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/guess_number.html) game:
     - Randomly generate a number within a specified range `[a, b]`.
     - Prompt the user to input a guess and keep track of the number of attempts.
     - Provide feedback if the guess is either "too large" or "too small."
     - When the user correctly guesses the number, display the total number of attempts.

**Task 3: Guess The Number Game (Advanced)**
   - Write a script to implement a more complex version of the  [`Guess The Number`](https://www.goobix.com/games/guess-the-number/) game:
     - Generate a random 4-digit number where each digit is unique and ranges from 0 to 9.
     - Allow the user a set number of attempts (e.g., 10 to begin with).
     - Provide feedback to the user regarding how many digits were guessed correctly and are in the correct positions, as well as how many digits were guessed correctly but are in different positions (correct digits, incorrect positions).
     - Continue the game until the specified number of attempts is exhausted and determine the win/loss status.

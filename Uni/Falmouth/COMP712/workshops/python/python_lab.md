# Workshop: Python Tutorial

In addition to our regular teaching sessions, we will be providing workshop materials utilising the Python programming language. These resources will complement the work you do in COMP712.

## Python Basics

Python is a lightweight, high-level, open-source, cross-platform, strongly-typed, and interpreted programming language.

- **Light-weight:** Python code typically has a small footprint. Basically, they are pure text.
- **High-level:** It is more user-friendly and human-readable than low-level languages like C.
- **Open-source:** Python source code is freely available.
- **Cross-platform:** It is independent of the computer's hardware architecture. The same code works on Windows, Linux/Unix, and Mac.
- **Strongly-typed:** Although variables donâ€™t have types, like you might be familiar with in other languages, values do.
- **Interpreted:** Python does not require compilation; it is interpreted at runtime.

In this session, I won't delve extensively into Python basics. As master's students, you should be able to grasp the fundamentals quickly. For detailed Python materials, please refer to the resources listed at the bottom of this guide, which are well-written and comprehensive.

## Installation

Python should already be installed on university machines. If you are using your own device, you can download the installation file from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

- **Note:** To ensure a successful installation, open a `Command Window` and type `python`. You should receive a response similar to:

    ```python
    C:\>python
    Python 3.10.11 (tags/v3.10.11:7d4cc5a, Apr  5 2023, 00:38:17) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>
    ```

Certainly! Here's a simple introduction to Python datatypes in Markdown format with code examples:

## Data Types

In Python, data types are used to categorise and manage different types of data. Python offers several built-in data types that help you work with various kinds of information. Here are some of the most commonly used data types in Python:

### Numeric Data Types

**Integers**
Integers (`int`) represent whole numbers. They can be positive or negative. Numerical operations such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` are supported for calculations.

Example:
```python
>>> x = 5
>>> y = -10
>>> x+y
-5
>>> x*y
-50
>>> 
```

**Floating-Point Numbers**
Floating-point numbers (`float`) represent real numbers with a decimal point. 

Example:
```python
>>> pi = 3.14159
>>> radius = 98.6
>>> pi * radius
309.76077399999997
>>>
```

**Strings**
Strings (`str`) are sequences of characters enclosed in single (`'` `'`), double (`"` `"`), or triple (`'''` `'''` or `"""` `"""`) quotes. The content of string can be displayed using `print` function. The operator `+` can be used to concatenate multiple strings.

Example:
```python
>>> name = 'John'
>>> message = "Hello, World!"
>>> multi_line = '''The first line
... The second line'''
>>> print(multi_line)
The first line
The second line
>>> print(name + ', ' + message)
John, Hello, World!
>>>
```

### Sequence

**Lists**
Lists (`list`) are ordered collections of items. They can contain elements of different data types. You can use the 0-based index to access certain item in the list.

Example:
```python
>>> fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> numbers[0]
1
>>> fruits[2]
'cherry'
>>> fruits[0] = 'grape'
>>> fruits
['grape', 'banana', 'cherry', 'pear']
>>>
```

Two list can be combined together using operator `+`, which is a shorthand of the normal `extend()` function (note: `extend()` doesn't return a new list, the change happens in-place). Individual items can be added to list using `append()` function.

```python
>>> fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> print(fruits + numbers)
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> numbers.extend(fruits)
>>> print(numbers)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
>>> fruits.append('pear')
>>> print(fruits)
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'pear']
>>>
```

**Tuples**
Tuples (`tuple`) are ordered collections like lists but are immutable (cannot be changed after creation). The item can be accessed in the same way as list. Notice the immutable property while trying to make change to the `tuple`.

Example:
```python
>>> coordinates = (2, 4)
>>> colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
>>> colors[0]
'red'
>>> coordinates[1]
4
>>> colors[0] = 'yellow'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
>>>
```

### Dictionaries
Dictionaries (`dict`) are collections of `key-value` pairs used to store data in an associative manner.

Example:
```python
>>> person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
>>> person['name']
'Alice'
>>> person['age']
30
>>>
```

### Booleans
Booleans (`bool`) represent two values, `True` and `False`, used for logical operations. The logical operations `and` and `or` are supported between variables. 

Example:
```python
>>> is_sunny = True
>>> is_raining = False
>>> is_sunny and is_raining
False
>>> is_sunny or is_raining
True
>>>
```

## Flow Control

In Python, flow control statements allow you to control the execution of your code. You can make decisions, create loops, and handle exceptions using these constructs. Here are some essential flow control statements:

### Conditional Statements

**`if`, `elif`, and `else`**

Conditional statements allow you to execute different code blocks based on specified conditions.

```python
>>> age = 18
>>> if age < 18:
...     print("You are a minor.")
... elif age == 18:
...     print("You just became an adult.")
... else:
...     print("You are an adult.")
...
You just became an adult.
>>>
```

### Loops

**`for` Loop**

A `for` loop iterates over a sequence (e.g., a list or range) and executes a block of code for each item.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

**`while` Loop**

A `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as a condition is `True`.

```python
>>> count = 0
>>> while count < 5:
...     print("Count:", count)
...     count += 1
...
Count: 0
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
>>>
```

### Control Statements

**`break`**

The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop prematurely.

```python
>>> for number in range(10):
...     if number == 5:
...         break
...     print(number)
...
0
1
2
3
4
>>>
```

**`continue`**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and proceeds to the next one.

```python
>>> for number in range(5):
...     if number == 2:
...         continue
...     print(number)
...
0
1
3
4
>>>
```

### Exception Handling

**`try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally`**

Exception handling helps you manage errors in your code.

```python
>>> try:
...     result = 10 / 0
... except ZeroDivisionError:
...     result = "Error: Division by zero"
... else:
...     result = "Result: " + str(result)
... finally:
...     print(result)
...
Error: Division by zero
>>>
```

By using flow control statements in Python, you can create dynamic and flexible programs that can make decisions, repeat tasks, and handle errors gracefully.

## Functions

Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They are essential for structuring and organising your code. 

### Defining a Function

To define a function, use the `def` keyword followed by the function name and any parameters it should accept. The function's code block is indented.

```python
>>> def greet(name):
...     return f"Hello, {name}!"
...
>>>
```

### Calling a Function

To use a function, call it by its name and provide any required arguments.

```python
>>> greet("Alice")
'Hello, Alice!'
>>>
```

### Parameters and Return Values

Functions can accept parameters (inputs) and return values (outputs).

```python
>>> def add(a, b):
...     return a + b
...
>>> result = add(3, 5)
>>> print(result)
8
>>>
```

### Default Parameters

You can set default values for function parameters.

```python
>>> def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
...     return f"{greeting}, {name}!"
...
>>> message = greet("Bob")
>>> print(message)
Hello, Bob!
>>>
```

### Variable Scope

Variables defined within a function have local scope, while those defined outside have global scope.

```python
>>> x = 10
>>>
>>> def multiply(y):
...     x = 2
...     return x * y
...
>>> result = multiply(5)
>>> print(result)
10
>>>
```

### Docstrings

Use docstrings to provide documentation for your functions. It should be the next line after your function definitions with content wrapped in triple quotation marks, either single (`'`) or double (`"`). The docstring can be viewed by calling `help()` function.

```python
>>> def square(x):
...     """
...     This function returns the square of a number.
...     """
...     return x ** 2
...
>>> help(square)
Help on function square in module __main__:

square(x)
    This function returns the square of a number.

>>>
```

### _Lambda Functions*_

Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword.

```python
>>> multiply = lambda x, y: x * y
>>> result = multiply(3, 4)
>>> print(result)
12
>>>
```

### Function Recursion

Functions can call themselves. Recursive functions are used for tasks that can be divided into smaller, similar tasks.

```python
>>> def factorial(n):
...     if n == 0:
...         return 1
...     else:
...         return n * factorial(n - 1)
...
>>> factorial(5)
120
>>>
```

## Classes

In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behaviours of objects of that class while facilitating object-oriented programming, which is a powerful paradigm for building complex systems.

### Defining a Class

To define a class, use the `class` keyword followed by the class name, and a colon. The class's attributes and methods are defined within the class block.

```python
class Dog:
    # Class attributes
    species = "Canis familiaris"
    
    # Constructor method
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    # Instance method
    def description(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old."
    
    # Another instance method
    def speak(self, sound):
        return f"{self.name} says {sound}."
```

### Creating Objects

To create an object (an instance) of a class, call the class as if it were a function with any required arguments.

```python
mikey = Dog("Mikey", 6)
```

### Accessing Attributes and Methods

You can access attributes and methods of an object using the `dot` (`.`) notation.

```python
>>> print(mikey.description())
Mikey is 6 years old.
>>> print(mikey.speak("Woof Woof"))
Mikey says Woof Woof.
>>>
```

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows you to create a new class based on an existing class. The new class inherits attributes and methods from the parent class.

```python
>>> class Beagle(Dog):
...     def run(self, speed):
...         return f"{self.name} runs at {speed}."
...
>>> buddy = Beagle("Buddy", 3)
>>> print(buddy.run("fast"))
Buddy runs at fast.
>>>
```

### Encapsulation

Python supports encapsulation, which means you can restrict access to certain attributes and methods using the underscores `_` convention. Such attributes and methods are protected and can only be accessed by the class itself.

```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        # Protected attribute
        self._radius = radius  
    
    def _calculate_area(self):
        # Protected method
        return 3.14159 * self._radius * self._radius  
```

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This is useful for creating flexible and dynamic code.

```python
>>> class Animal:
...     def __init__(self,name,age):
...         self._name = name
...         self._age = age
...
...     def speak(self):
...         return ('Animal speaks!')
...
>>> class Dog(Animal):
...     def __init__(self,name,age):
...         super().__init__(name,age)
...
...     def speak(self):
...         return 'Woof woof!'
...
>>> class Cat(Animal):
...     def __init__(self,name,age):
...         super().__init__(name,age)
...
...     def speak(self):
...         return 'Meow meow!'
...
>>> my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 5)
>>> my_cat = Cat("Whiskers", 3)
>>> class Animal:
...     def __init__(self,name,age):
...         self._name = name
...         self._age = age
...
...     def speak(self):
...         return ('Animal speaks!')
...
>>> class Dog(Animal):
...     def __init__(self,name,age):
...         super().__init__(name,age)
...
...     def speak(self):
...         print(f'{self._name} says: Woof woof!')
...
>>> class Cat(Animal):
...     def __init__(self,name,age):
...         super().__init__(name,age)
...
...     def speak(self):
...         print(f'{self._name} says: Meow meow!')
...
>>> my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 5)
>>> my_cat = Cat("Whiskers", 3)
>>> my_dog.speak()
Buddy says: Woof woof!
>>> my_cat.speak()
Whiskers says: Meow meow!
>>>
```

## File Operations

File operations in Python allow you to interact with files on your computer. You can read, write, and manipulate data in files. Here's how to work with files:

### Opening a File

You can open a file using the `open()` function. Provide the file's path and specify the mode ('r' for reading, 'w' for writing, 'a' for appending, 'b' for binary mode, etc.).

```python
# Opening a file for reading
file = open("example.txt", "r")
```

### Reading from a File

To read the content of a file, you can use various methods like `read()`, `readline()`, or `readlines()`.

```python
# Read the entire file
content = file.read()

# Read a single line
line = file.readline()

# Read all lines into a list
lines = file.readlines()
```

### Writing to a File

To write to a file, open it in write (`'w'`) or append (`'a'`) mode and use the `write()` method.

```python
# Open a file for writing
file = open("output.txt", "w")

# Write a line to the file
file.write("Hello, World!\n")
```

### Closing a File

Always close a file after you're done with it using the `close()` method to free up system resources.

```python
file.close()
```

### Using 'with' Statement

A better practice is to use the '`with`' statement, which ensures the file is properly closed even if an error occurs.

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
```

### Reading and Writing Binary Files

You can read and write binary files by specifying the '`b`' mode.

```python
with open("binary_data.bin", "rb") as binary_file:
    data = binary_file.read()

with open("new_binary_data.bin", "wb") as new_binary_file:
    new_binary_file.write(data)
```

### Handling Exceptions

When working with files, it's important to handle exceptions, especially if the file may not exist.

```python
try:
    with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The file does not exist.")
```

Python's file operations make it easy to work with text and binary files, which is essential for tasks such as data reading, writing, and processing. Always remember to close files properly to avoid resource leaks.

## Package Management

Python package management involves installing, managing, and using external libraries or packages in your Python projects. The most common tool for package management in Python is `pip`. Here are some key operations:

### Installing Packages

You can install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using `pip`. Simply provide the package name as an argument.

```bash
pip install package_name
```

Example:
```bash
pip install requests
```

### Listing Installed Packages

You can list all the packages installed in your Python environment using `pip list`.

```bash
pip list
```

### Creating a `requirements.txt` File

A `requirements.txt` file lists all the packages your project depends on, making it easy to recreate your project's environment on another system.

Create the file:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Example `requirements.txt`:
```text
requests==2.26.0
flask==2.1.1
numpy==1.21.0
```

### Installing Packages from a `requirements.txt` File

To install packages listed in a `requirements.txt` file, use the `-r` flag.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs all the packages listed in the file.

Python package management is crucial for utilizing external libraries and packages to enhance the functionality of your Python projects. Using `pip` and `requirements.txt` files simplifies the process of package installation and project environment management.

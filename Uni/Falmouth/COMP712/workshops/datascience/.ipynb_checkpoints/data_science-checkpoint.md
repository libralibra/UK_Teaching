# Introduction

[Top](#top)

Welcome to this comprehensive workshop on Data Science using Python!

In this session, we'll delve into the essential Python libraries for scientific computation and machine learning: `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, and `Pandas`. These powerful tools will empower us to handle data manipulation, visualisation, and analysis, laying the foundation for building sophisticated machine learning models.

Apart from familiarising yourselves with these libraries, you will write your code in `JupyterLab` - the integrated interactive development environment.

# Preparation 

[Top](#top)

To work with Jupyter notebook, I would assume you have all the necessary libraries and tools installed successfully. For instance, you should have the following libraries on the machine you are working on:

- `python`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `pandas`
- `jupyterlab`

If any of the software or libraries are not installed, please follow the instructions below to get them installed. 

0. install python from [Python Website](https://www.python.org/)

1. Use Python's package manager, `pip`, to install the required libraries. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

 ```bash
    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install scipy
    pip install pandas
    pip install jupyterlab
```

2. You can also combine them together as one command as:

```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib scipy pandas jupyterlab
```

3. And, more importantly, install `JupyterLab` using the command:
   
```bash
   pip install jupyterlab
```

4. If `JupyterLab` has been installed properly, you have two options to run the notebook:
   
   1. Start a command window and type 
   ```bash
      jupyter lab
   ```
    , which will initiate the jupyter server and automatically open a browser to the current working folder.
   
   2. Run the notebook directly within Visual Studio Code, utilising the Jupyter extension that supports notebook editing and previewing.
